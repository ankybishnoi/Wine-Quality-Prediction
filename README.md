# Wine-Quality-Prediction
In this Project I have developed Machine Learning model for predicting Wine Quality based on different Independant Features that are given and complete Report is made on top of it.

This was freelencer project is recieved So For completing this i have applied some 
machine learning algorithms
SVM, Decison Tree and Random forest are main 
and also applied some of the technique like 
StandardScaler, Grid SearchCV
and got accuracy around 89% in all the algorithms and made a complete thesis on it
icluding Refrence, Ethicial Use cases, Future work, Scalability and all these things.
